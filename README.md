P4: Red-black tree

For full credit:

Implement the tree as a template, to support multiple data types
Get timings for lookups with 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000 million items. Compare this to an unsorted linked list (linear search)
	You can use the chrono header: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/
Don't worry about deletion, just do insertion, and find
Override the necessary comparison operators to allow to do checks (< and = can suffice)
Create a recursive function to check if the tree has the same number of black nodes along each simple path (black height)
You may need nil nodes to simplify your code
